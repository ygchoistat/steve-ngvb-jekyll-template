I am a postdoctoral fellow in Public Health Division of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. 
My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, multivariate analysis, optimization, and causal inference. In particular, my current works are focused on developing high- dimensional and robust inferences for personalized medicine. When I was at SNU, I focused on inferences on large-scale covariance matrices, longitudinal data analysis, and survival analysis. As a collaborator, I have been involved in projects on cohort studies, electronic health records, and mass-spectrometry data.
