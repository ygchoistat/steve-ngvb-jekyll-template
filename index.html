<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>I'm a research scientist in Data Labs at SK Telecom, South Korea.  
My research interests lie broadly in applied statistics, with emphasis on multivariate data analysis, causal inference and anomaly detection.
My current projects include real-time fault detection and root cause analysis in hi-tech manufacturing processes. 
Prior to these, I have conducted research on the following items: treatment selection and clinical surveillance from large-scale healthcare databases; statistical inferences on large-scale covariance matrices; longitudinal data analysis; and survival analysis.</p>


<p>
Before joining SK Telecom, I was a biostat postdoc at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (`16-`18, mentored by Dr. Yingqi Zhao), and at Seoul National University (`15-`16, mentored by Dr. Myunghee Cho Paik).
I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics, Seoul National University in 2015, under the supervision of Prof. Johan Lim. I also graduated from SNU in 2010 and took my B.S. in mathematics education.
