<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the Biostatistics and Biomathematics Program, Public Health Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, mentored by Dr. Yingqi Zhao. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, multivariate analysis, optimization, and causal inference. In particular, my current works are focused on developing high-dimensional and robust inferences for individualized treatment rules, which assigns the treatments according to different patient's characteristics.</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics, Seoul National University in 2015, under the supervision of Prof. Johan Lim. I also graduated from SNU in 2010 and took my B.S. in mathematics education.
When I was in Seoul, I focused on inferences on large-scale covariance matrices, longitudinal data analysis, and survival analysis. As a collaborator, I have been involved in projects on cohort studies, electronic health records, and mass-spectrometry data.</p>
